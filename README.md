# Version 0.1HF (January 19, 2024) - (another version)
Detailed explanations are provided in the link below.
http://www.hamskey.com

- Separate version released for UV-K5 modified with SI4732-A10
- This version is different from the existing CEC version. To run this firmware as a testing version, be sure to remove BK1080 and replace it with SI4732-A10.
- Remove all unnecessary functions other than the basic functions of the radio (to secure programming space)


# Version 0.1P (January 13, 2024)
- Improved variables that use excessive memory to secure program memory
- Removal of the spectrum function (it is maintained in the source code. If you need it, you can select the activation option when distributing the source code later)
- Added CW, CWF, CWN modes
- Added CW-related settings
The current version will be tested for 1-2 weeks and then redistributed as stable version 0.2. If you don't want to be a beta tester, you can download 0.2 in 1-2 weeks.


# Version 0.1M (January 10, 2024)
1. Add Text Configuration (Call sign, name, dx callsign, dx name, grid, CW Messages for builtin keyer)
2. Add Some function to Text Editor
3. Builtin SSTV Transmitter   (M1 Mode) (not need any device, stand alone)


# Version 0.1c (January 5, 2024)
This version fixes the parts that amateur radio operators found most inconvenient.
1. Add Mhz button when entering frequency. If you want to move the frequency to 28.010, enter 28*010  (* button as Mhz button)
2. Operating in Live mode when moving the frequency quickly (receiving while moving the frequency)
3. Free up some memory for future tasks
4. This version is a stable version and the source code was released together. Various experimental elements will be added from the next version, and as announced, the source code will be finalized and released upon the release of version 1.0.


# Version 0.1b (January 2, 2024)
I worked on the first firmware. I did what was requested by the user.
Alternatively, functions that are not greatly needed in amateur radio were changed to those that are needed in amateur radio.
1. I took the source code from https://github.com/egzumer/uv-k5-firmware-custom and created a new project.
2. Change the environment so that it can be used in Visual Studio Code  (win_make.bat, makefile option ...)
3. Remove some unnecessary variables for operation
4. Changed the BCL function to be selectable at the compilation stage. (Because BCL is not often used in amateur radio), If you need the BCL function, just set the compilation options. (ENABLE_BCL  ?= 0)
5. Changed all band TX activation from 10 times to once (this can also be operated in the old form in the makefile) (This is because you working in the Hiddel Menu anyway)
6. The 350TX, 350EN, and 500TX functions have been changed to amateur radio bands. Even if TX 350 and TX 500 are ENABLE, they only operate under certain conditions. (Default Range Mode) , In countries where the TX function must be tested for radio use, TX on all frequencies must be within range. To receive permission for 900Mhz or 1.2Ghz, just enable TX900 and (TX126 OR TX127 - Each country has different licensed frequency bands. Just choose the band that suits you.)


# Important notice about firmware  
* The program will be modified starting today (January 2, 2024) based on egzummer's UV_K5 version.
* Any parts that are added or removed from existing features will be specified above this part.
* I plan to add quite a few features, and to secure flash memory space, I plan to remove visual elements that do not have a significant impact on radio performance. (ex : bargraph, icon, usb connected...)
* The source will continue to be modified, and the compiled firmware will be released as a beta version.
* Sources will be uploaded by major version (ex : version 1.0, 2.0, 3.0). This is because there is a high possibility that sources will be created or removed in large units.
* See below for all features and descriptions prior to January 2, 2024. 

I am always grateful to the UV-K5 firmware contributors for creating a new playground.
DE KD8CE

# The source was taken from the EGZUMER repository on January 2, 2024 
 * Please refer to the previous functions below.
 * This firmware contains various experimental elements. It will be distributed as a beta version before releasing the major version.
 * EGZUMMER's firmware for the stable version.
 * Once again, we would like to thank Dual Tachyon and egzummer for doing such great work and providing a playground for many developers.

# Open re-implementation of the Quansheng UV-K5/K6/5R v2.1.27 firmware

This repository is a merge of [OneOfEleven custom firmware](https://github.com/OneOfEleven/uv-k5-firmware-custom) with [fagci spectrum analizer](https://github.com/fagci/uv-k5-firmware-fagci-mod/tree/refactor) plus my few changes.<br>
All is a cloned and customized version of DualTachyon's open firmware found [here](https://github.com/DualTachyon/uv-k5-firmware) ... a cool achievement !

> [!WARNING]  
> Use this firmware at your own risk (entirely). There is absolutely no guarantee that it will work in any way shape or form on your radio(s), it may even brick your radio(s), in which case, you'd need to buy another radio.
Anyway, have fun.

 ## Manual

Up to date manual is available in the [Wiki section](https://github.com/egzumer/uv-k5-firmware-custom/wiki)

## Radio performance

Please note that the Quansheng UV-Kx radios are not professional quality transceivers, their
performance is strictly limited. The RX front end has no track-tuned band pass filtering
at all, and so are wide band/wide open to any and all signals over a large frequency range.

Using the radio in high intensity RF environments will most likely make reception anything but
easy (AM mode will suffer far more than FM ever will), the receiver simply doesn't have a
great dynamic range, which results in distorted AM audio with stronger RX'ed signals.
There is nothing more anyone can do in firmware/software to improve that, once the RX gain
adjustment I do (AM fix) reaches the hardwares limit, your AM RX audio will be all but
non-existent (just like Quansheng's firmware).
On the other hand, FM RX audio will/should be fine.

But, they are nice toys for the price, fun to play with.

## User customization

You can customize the firmware by enabling/disabling various compile options, this allows
us to remove certain firmware features in order to make room in the flash for others.
You'll find the options at the top of "Makefile" ('0' = disable, '1' = enable) ..

## Compiler

arm-none-eabi GCC version 10.3.1 is recommended, which is the current version on Ubuntu 22.04.03 LTS.
Other versions may generate a flash file that is too big.
You can get an appropriate version from: https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/gnu-rm

clang may be used but isn't fully supported. Resulting binaries may also be bigger.
You can get it from: https://releases.llvm.org/download.html

## Building

### Github Codespace build method

This is the least demanding option as you don't have to install enything on your computer. All you need is Github account.

1. Go to https://github.com/egzumer/uv-k5-firmware-custom
1. Click green `Code` button
1. Change tab from `Local` to `Codespace`
1. Click green `Create codespace on main` button

<img src="images/codespace1.png" width=700 />

5. Open `Makefile`
1. Edit build options, save `Makefile` changes
1. Run `./compile-with-docker.sh` in terminal window
1. Open folder `compiled-firmware`
1. Right click `firmware.packed.bin`
1. Click `Download`, now you should have a firmware on your computer that you can proceed to flash on your radio. You can use [online flasher](https://egzumer.github.io/uvtools)

<img src="images/codespace2.png" width=700 />

### Docker build method

If you have docker installed you can use [compile-with-docker.bat](./compile-with-docker.bat) (Windows) or [compile-with-docker.sh](./compile-with-docker.sh) (Linux/Mac), the output files are created in `compiled-firmware` folder. This method gives significantly smaller binaries, I've seen differences up to 1kb, so it can fit more functionalities this way. The challenge can be (or not) installing docker itself.

### Windows environment build method

1. Open windows command line and run:
    ```
    winget install -e -h git.git Python.Python.3.8 GnuWin32.Make
    winget install -e -h Arm.GnuArmEmbeddedToolchain -v "10 2021.10"
    ```
2. Close command line, open a new one and run:
    ```
    pip install --user --upgrade pip
    pip install crcmod
    mkdir c:\projects & cd /D c:/projects
    git clone https://github.com/egzumer/uv-k5-firmware-custom.git
    ```
3. From now on you can build the firmware by going to `c:\projects\uv-k5-firmware-custom` and running `win_make.bat` or by running a command line:
    ```
    cd /D c:\projects\uv-k5-firmware-custom
    win_make.bat
    ```
4. To reset the repository and pull new changes run (!!! it will delete all your changes !!!):
    ```
    cd /D c:\projects\uv-k5-firmware-custom
    git reset --hard & git clean -fd & git pull
    ```

I've left some notes in the win_make.bat file to maybe help with stuff.
